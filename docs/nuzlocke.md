# Important Nuzlocke Information (v1.0.0) 

## General Philosophy

Drayano projects are extremely popular to Nuzlocke and have been for many years. There has been a growing demand for harder Drayano titles, however many just want to play casually.

 - Indeed, these older projects aren't specifically designed to be nuzlocked and have always been designed for regular play-throughs. 
 
With this in mind, Redux attempts to cater to both Casual and Veteran players by expanding the in-built difficulty system in Black 2 and White 2.

 - Upon game start, the player is prompted to save the game after a chat with your mother and to talk to the Key Bearer. Once you've spoken to him, the game will save again. 
 - This guarantees that the player correctly receives the difficulty keys.
 
## Difficulty Options

With the difficulty keys, the player can choose between three different difficulty modes.

 - Whilst not so much an issue if playing on Easy or Normal mode, switching to lower difficulties for certain battles on challenge mode can break certain scripts.
 - Thus, to be completely safe, pick your preferred difficulty at the start of the game and stick with it. 

Normal Mode

 - The standard difficulty of Dray's other work. For example, Normal mode is equivalent in difficulty to Renegade Platinum or BB2 and VW2. 
 - Trainers shouldn't be impossible to beat and generally stick to single battles, but are definitely a much greater challenge than in Black 2 and White 2. 
 - You can expect some of your Pokémon to faint in battle unless you bring some strategies of your own to the table. 
 - Gym leaders start with fewer Pokémon, building up to a full team of six.


Easy Mode

 - A casual, laid back experience. 
 - All trainer teams are shared with Normal Mode, but have reduced levels and a.i. difficulty. 
 - Perfect for experiencing the new changes to Unova, without any of the difficulty heartache.


Challenge Mode

 - In the era of Radical Red, many in the community crave a more challenging Pokémon experience. However, many yearn for the Vanilla feel of such a challenge. This is where challenge mode comes in!
 - Gym leaders will all use full teams of six from the get-go.
 - Important trainers will use a mix of Single, Double and Triple battles against you. This keeps the player on their toes and forces them to consider different strategies between battles.
 - Redux features a selection of exclusive challenge mode encounters and battles, including Lance and a double battle with Lenora and her Husband!
 - Other regular trainers all have their levels dynamically scaled, depending on the number of badges earned, like in Vanilla. This scales upto a maximum of +7 levels, depending on the area.
 - Important trainers don't use items in battle, to help prevent player abuse of their predictability.
 - The player is healed before most important battles to prevent Guts/Poison Heal/Quick Feet etc abuse. This also helpfully reduces gym backtracking and helps keep the player on equal footing with the a.i.


## Encounter Locations by Split

!!! Note
    This is a work in progress. Splits are made where they make sense. Does not take into account the special encounters in each route.
