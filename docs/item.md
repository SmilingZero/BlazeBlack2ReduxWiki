## Pickup Table Changes

Various tweaks have been made to the pickup table. This is the 'loot pool' for Pokémon with the ability Pickup.

 - All instances of Leftovers have been replaced with a Lucky Egg.
 - All instances of a Sun Stone have been replaced with a Sticky Barb.
 - All instances of a Moon Stone have been replaced with a Lagging Tail.
 - All instances of a King's Rock have been replaced with a PP Max.

These changes will only realistically effect <1% of players.



## Castelia Berry Guy, Battle Subway and PWT Prizes


On Challenge Mode only, the BP prize vendors and the Castelia Cafe artist are all absent until the postgame.

 - This change is to help prevent players from obtaining powerful held items like the Focus Sash and certain TMs early.
 - Few will ever sit and grind out the required BP to legitimately acquire these items, so by removing the vendors the playing field is levelled.
 - Furthermore, this has been commonly requested by the community!
 
Upon entering the postgame, the vendors will reappear upon sighting Suicune on Route 3.
This change will only realistically effect <5% of players.
