# Wild Area Changes (v1.4.1)


## General Changes


The Wild Pokémon in each area have been modified, as is standard in these kinds of projects.

 - The levels listed for an area are the minimum and maximum levels that you may encounter in that area.
 - Please note that many Pokémon can only be encountered at one specific level.
 - The Super Rod is the only obtainable Rod in Gen V, as is given out after defeating Cheren on Route 20, from Cheren.
    - Thus Fishing is grouped under one heading.

## A quick word on Nuzlocking: 

A common metric for if an encounter is allowed in Nuzlockes is the 'Area Name', as can be seen by saving in an area. Typically, only one encounter is allowed per 'Area Name'.

 - Virbank Complex has been split into the Outer Complex and Inner Complex to allow for an extra encounter.
 - Castelia City has been split into Castelia City and Castelia Gardens to allow for an extra encounter.
 - The Guidance Chamber has been removed and merged with Mistralton Cave, to remove a potential encounter.
 - These are both very deliberate changes. Nuzlockes of Redux have been tested and balanced around these changes.
 - You can see both of these changes by saving the game in the respective locations.

You are of course, free to play as you see fit. If you don't like these changes, you can ignore them ;).

!!! note
    When I (Zero) processed the "Wild Area Changes" text file, I merged areas that all share a "Area Name" to streamline this for nuzlocking for personal utility.
