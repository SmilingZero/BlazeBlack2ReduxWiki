# Gift Pokémon and Special Encounters (v1.4.1)                     

## General Notes

All Pokémon here have the normal chance to be shiny. There are no shiny locks.

 - Thus, you can soft reset for shinies. 
 - The Starter Gifts do not show if the Pokémon is shiny in the little picture. This cannot be implemented sadly!

See the [static encounters page](https://www.serebii.net/black2white2/interact.shtml) on Serebii for more information.
