| Tutor | Uproar | 90 | 100 | 10 | ![][normal] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. User is forced to use this move for 2–5 turns, selected at random.

This applies even if both Pokémon had a choice item before this move was used.  If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.<br><br>Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.<br><br>This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome. |

The next time a Pokémon uses a beneficial move on itself or itself and its ally this turn, the user of this move will steal the move and use it itself.  Moves which may be stolen by this move are identified by the "snatchable" flag.<br><br>If two Pokémon use this move on the same turn, the faster Pokémon will steal the first beneficial move, and the slower Pokémon will then steal it again—thus, only the slowest Pokémon using this move ultimately gains a stolen move's effect.<br><br>If the user steals psych up, it will target the Pokémon that used psych up.  If the user was the original target of psych up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome. |
