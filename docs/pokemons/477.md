| Tutor | Spite | None | 100 | 10 | ![][ghost] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Lowers the PP of the target's last used move by 4.

| Tutor | Trick | None | 100 | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. User and target permanently swap held items.  Works even if one of the Pokémon isn't holding anything.

If the user was the original target of psych up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome. |
| Tutor | Sleep Talk | None | None | 10 | ![][normal] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Only usable if the user is sleeping. Randomly selects and uses one of the user's other three moves. Use of the selected move requires and costs 0 PP. |
