Moves which may be stolen by this move are identified by the "snatchable" flag.<br><br>If two Pokémon use this move on the same turn, the faster Pokémon will steal the first beneficial move, and the slower Pokémon will then steal it again—thus, only the slowest Pokémon using this move ultimately gains a stolen move's effect.<br><br>If the user steals psych up, it will target the Pokémon that used psych up.  If the user was the original target of psych up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome. |

No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.<br><br>This effect breaks through wonder guard.<br><br>If the target is protected by protect or detect on the turn this move is used, this move will fail.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.<br><br>The damage is applied at the end of the turn, so it ignores endure and focus sash.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
