## Level Up Moves
| Level | Name | Power | Accuracy | PP | Type | Damage Class | Effect |
|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|
| 31 | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.  For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pokémon on the field is lowered by two stages.  Cancels the effects of bounce, fly, and sky drop.<br><br>Specifically, flying Pokémon and those with levitate or that have used magnet rise are no longer immune to ground attacks, arena trap, spikes, or toxic spikes.<br><br>bounce, fly, sky drop, high jump kick, jump kick, and splash cannot be used while this move is in effect.<br><br>*Bug*: If this move is used during a double or triple battle while Pokémon are under the effect of sky drop, Sky Drop's effect is not correctly canceled on its target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely.  As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |
| 1 | Teleport | None | None | 20 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: -6. Does nothing.  Wild battles end immediately. |
| 1 | Hidden Power | 60 | 100 | 15 | ![][normal] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Power and type depend upon user's IVs. Power can range from 30 to 70. |

| 19 | Disable | None | 100 | 20 | ![][normal] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Disables the target's last used move, preventing its use for 4–7 turns, selected at random, or until the target leaves the field.  If the target hasn't used a move since entering the field, if it tried to use a move this turn and failed,  if its last used move has 0 PP remaining, or if it already has a move disabled, this move will fail. |
| 20 | Shock Wave | 60 | None | 20 | ![][electric] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers. |
| 22 | Miracle Eye | None | None | 40 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Resets the target's evasion to normal and prevents any further boosting until the target leaves the field.

| 23 | Ally Switch | None | None | 15 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 2. User switches position on the field with the friendly Pokémon opposite it.  If the user is in the middle position in a triple battle, or there are no other friendly Pokémon, this move will fail. |

| 31 | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.  For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pokémon on the field is lowered by two stages.  Cancels the effects of bounce, fly, and sky drop.<br><br>Specifically, flying Pokémon and those with levitate or that have used magnet rise are no longer immune to ground attacks, arena trap, spikes, or toxic spikes.<br><br>bounce, fly, sky drop, high jump kick, jump kick, and splash cannot be used while this move is in effect.<br><br>*Bug*: If this move is used during a double or triple battle while Pokémon are under the effect of sky drop, Sky Drop's effect is not correctly canceled on its target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely.  As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |
| 34 | Telekinesis | None | None | 15 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For three turns (including this one), moves used against the target have 100% accuracy, but the target is immune to ground damage.  Accuracy of one-hit KO moves is exempt from this effect.<br><br>This effect is removed by gravity.  If Gravity is already in effect, this move will fail. |

This move cannot score a critical hit.  If the target switches out, its replacement will be hit instead.

No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.<br><br>This effect breaks through wonder guard.<br><br>If the target is protected by protect or detect on the turn this move is used, this move will fail.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.<br><br>The damage is applied at the end of the turn, so it ignores endure and focus sash.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| 42 | Role Play | None | None | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. User's ability is replaced with the target's until the user leaves the field.  Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers.<br><br>If the target has flower gift, forecast, illusion, imposter, multitype, stance change, trace, wonder guard, or zen mode, this move will fail.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| 46 | Psychic | 90 | 100 | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage. |
| 49 | Trick | None | 100 | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. User and target permanently swap held items.  Works even if one of the Pokémon isn't holding anything.  If either Pokémon is holding mail, this move will fail.<br><br>If either Pokémon has multitype or sticky hold, this move will fail.<br><br>If this move results in a Pokémon obtaining choice band, choice scarf, or choice specs, and that Pokémon was the latter of the pair to move this turn, then the move it used this turn becomes its chosen forced move.  This applies even if both Pokémon had a choice item before this move was used.  If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.<br><br>Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.<br><br>This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome. |
| 52 | Stored Power | 20 | 100 | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Power is increased by 100% its original value for every stage any of the user's stats have been raised.  Accuracy, evasion, and lowered stats do not affect this move's power.  For a Pokémon with all five stats modified to +6, this move's power is 31×. |
| 56 | Nasty Plot | None | None | 20 | ![][dark] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Raises the user's Special Attack by two stages. |
