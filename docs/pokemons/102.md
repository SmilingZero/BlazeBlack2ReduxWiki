## Tutor Moves
| &nbsp; | Name | Power | Accuracy | PP | Type | Damage Class | Effect |
|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|
| Tutor | Seed Bomb | 80 | 100 | 15 | ![][grass] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. Inflicts regular damage. |
| Tutor | Uproar | 90 | 100 | 10 | ![][normal] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. User is forced to use this move for 2–5 turns, selected at random. No Pokemon can sleep during the effect of this move.  |

| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.
