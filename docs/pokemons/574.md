As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |

If the first of the two Pokémon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.<br><br>Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.<br><br>This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome. |

If the user was the original target of psych up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome. |
| Tutor | Sleep Talk | None | None | 10 | ![][normal] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Only usable if the user is sleeping. Randomly selects and uses one of the user's other three moves. Use of the selected move requires and costs 0 PP. |
