## Tutor Moves
| &nbsp; | Name | Power | Accuracy | PP | Type | Damage Class | Effect |
|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|
| Tutor | Signal Beam | 75 | 100 | 15 | ![][bug] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Has a 10% chance to confuse the target. |
| Tutor | Magic Coat | None | None | 15 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 4. The first non-damaging move targeting the user this turn that inflicts major status effects, stat changes, or trapping effects will be reflected at its user.<br><br>defog, memento, and teeter dance are not reflected.<br><br>attract, flatter, gastro acid, leech seed, swagger, worry seed, and yawn are reflected.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.
