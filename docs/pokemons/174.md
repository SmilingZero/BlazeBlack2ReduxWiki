## Tutor Moves
| &nbsp; | Name | Power | Accuracy | PP | Type | Damage Class | Effect |
|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|: --- :|
| Tutor | Covet | 60 | 100 | 20 | ![][fairy] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. If the target is holding an item and the user is not, the user will permanently take the item.  Damage is still inflicted if an item cannot be taken.<br><br>Pokémon with sticky hold or multitype are immune to the item theft effect.<br><br>The target cannot recover its item with recycle. |
| Tutor | Bounce | 85 | 85 | 5 | ![][flying] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. User bounces high into the air for one turn, becoming immune to attack, and hits on the second turn.

| Tutor | Uproar | 90 | 100 | 10 | ![][normal] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. User is forced to use this move for 2–5 turns, selected at random. No Pokemon can sleep during the effect of this move.  |

The first non-damaging move targeting the user this turn that inflicts major status effects, stat changes, or trapping effects will be reflected at its user.<br><br>defog, memento, and teeter dance are not reflected.<br><br>attract, flatter, gastro acid, leech seed, swagger, worry seed, and yawn are reflected.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.

As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |
