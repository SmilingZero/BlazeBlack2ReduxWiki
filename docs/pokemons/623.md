| Tutor | Earth Power | 90 | 100 | 10 | ![][ground] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage. |
| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.  For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pok√©mon on the field is lowered by two stages.
