No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.<br><br>This effect breaks through wonder guard.<br><br>If the target is protected by protect or detect on the turn this move is used, this move will fail.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.<br><br>The damage is applied at the end of the turn, so it ignores endure and focus sash.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
