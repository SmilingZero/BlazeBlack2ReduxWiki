## Tutor Moves
| &nbsp; | Name | Power | Accuracy | PP | Type | Damage Class | Effect |

The first non-damaging move targeting the user this turn that inflicts major status effects, stat changes, or trapping effects will be reflected at its user.<br><br>defog, memento, and teeter dance are not reflected.<br><br>attract, flatter, gastro acid, leech seed, swagger, worry seed, and yawn are reflected.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |

| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.  For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pokémon on the field is lowered by two stages.

As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |
