| 1 | Perish Song | None | None | 5 | ![][normal] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Every Pokémon is given a counter that starts at 3 and decreases by 1 at the end of every turn, including this one.  When a Pokémon's counter reaches zero, that Pokémon faints.  A Pokémon that leaves the field will lose its counter; its replacement does not inherit the effect, and other Pokémon's counters remain.<br><br>This effect is passed on by baton pass.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| 1 | Sing | None | 55 | 15 | ![][normal] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Puts the target to sleep. |
