## Tutor Moves

The first non-damaging move targeting the user this turn that inflicts major status effects, stat changes, or trapping effects will be reflected at its user.<br><br>defog, memento, and teeter dance are not reflected.<br><br>attract, flatter, gastro acid, leech seed, swagger, worry seed, and yawn are reflected.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.
