## Level Up Moves
| Level | Name | Power | Accuracy | PP | Type | Damage Class | Effect |

| 1 | Cosmic Power | None | None | 20 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Raises the user's Defense and Special Defense by one stage. |
| 1 | Dual Wingbeat | 40 | 90 | 10 | ![][flying] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. Inflicts regular damage. |
| 1 | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.  For the duration of this effect, the evasion of every Pokémon on the field is lowered by two stages.  Cancels the effects of bounce, fly, and sky drop.<br><br>Specifically, flying Pokémon and those with levitate or that have used magnet rise are no longer immune to ground attacks, arena trap, spikes, or toxic spikes.<br><br>bounce, fly, sky drop, high jump kick, jump kick, and splash cannot be used while this move is in effect.<br><br>*Bug*: If this move is used during a double or triple battle while Pokémon are under the effect of sky drop, Sky Drop's effect is not correctly canceled on its target, and it remains high in the air indefinitely.  As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |
| 1 | Miracle Eye | None | None | 40 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Resets the target's evasion to normal and prevents any further boosting until the target leaves the field.  A dark Pokémon under this effect takes normal damage from psychic moves.  This move itself ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers. |
| 4 | Swift | 60 | None | 20 | ![][normal] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers. |
| 7 | Hypnosis | None | 60 | 20 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Puts the target to sleep. |

Accuracy, evasion, and lowered stats do not affect this move's power.  For a Pokémon with all five stats modified to +6, this move's power is 31×. |
| 16 | Gust | 40 | 100 | 25 | ![][flying] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Inflicts regular damage.<br><br>If the target is under the effect of bounce, fly, or sky drop, this move will hit with double power. |

This move cannot score a critical hit.  If the target switches out, its replacement will be hit instead.  Damage is calculated at the time this move is used; stat changes and switching out during the delay won't change the damage inflicted.  No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.<br><br>This effect breaks through wonder guard.<br><br>If the target is protected by protect or detect on the turn this move is used, this move will fail.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.<br><br>The damage is applied at the end of the turn, so it ignores endure and focus sash.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| 37 | Synchronoise | 120 | 100 | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. Only Pokémon that share a type with the user will take damage from this move. |

| 60 | Mirror Move | None | None | 20 | ![][flying] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Uses the last move targeted at the user by a Pokémon still on the field.
