| 1 | Spacial Rend | 100 | 95 | 5 | ![][dragon] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. User's critical hit rate is one level higher when using this move. |
| 1 | Shadow Force | 120 | 100 | 5 | ![][ghost] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. User vanishes for one turn, becoming immune to attack, and hits on the second turn.<br><br>This move ignores the effects of detect and protect.<br><br>This move cannot be selected by sleep talk. |
| 1 | Seismic Toss | None | 100 | 20 | ![][fighting] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. Inflicts damage equal to the user's level.  Type immunity applies, but other type effects are ignored. |

| 1 | Natural Gift | None | 100 | 15 | ![][normal] | ![][physical] | Priority: 0. Power and type are determined by the user's held berry.  The berry is consumed.  If the user is not holding a berry, this move will fail. |
| 6 | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.

As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |

No move with this effect can be used against the same target again until after the end of the third turn.<br><br>This effect breaks through wonder guard.<br><br>If the target is protected by protect or detect on the turn this move is used, this move will fail.  However, the damage on the third turn will break through protection.<br><br>The damage is applied at the end of the turn, so it ignores endure and focus sash.<br><br>This move cannot be copied by mirror move. |
| 30 | Esper Wing | 70 | 100 | 10 | ![][psychic] | ![][special] | Priority: 1. None |
| 34 | Perish Song | None | None | 5 | ![][normal] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. Every Pokémon is given a counter that starts at 3 and decreases by 1 at the end of every turn, including this one.
