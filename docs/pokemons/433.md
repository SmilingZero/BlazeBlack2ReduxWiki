| Tutor | Uproar | 90 | 100 | 10 | ![][normal] | ![][special] | Priority: 0. User is forced to use this move for 2–5 turns, selected at random.

| Tutor | Gravity | None | None | 5 | ![][psychic] | ![][status] | Priority: 0. For five turns (including this one), all immunities to ground moves are disabled.

As Sky Drop prevents the target from acting, the only way to subsequently remove it from the field is to faint it. |

| Tutor | Snatch | None | None | 10 | ![][dark] | ![][status] | Priority: 4. The next time a Pokémon uses a beneficial move on itself or itself and its ally this turn, the user of this move will steal the move and use it itself.  Moves which may be stolen by this move are identified by the "snatchable" flag.<br><br>If two Pokémon use this move on the same turn, the faster Pokémon will steal the first beneficial move, and the slower Pokémon will then steal it again—thus, only the slowest Pokémon using this move ultimately gains a stolen move's effect.<br><br>If the user steals psych up, it will target the Pokémon that used psych up.
