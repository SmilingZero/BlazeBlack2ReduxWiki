# Useful Action Replay Codes
## General Notes

This is a small selection of Action Replay codes you might find useful whilst playing Redux.
!!! note
    As of v1.1.0, the following codes are now redundant. They have been baked right into the game!



## The Codes

### Instant Shaking Grass/Water Ripple/Dust Cloud:

- Hold 'L' for an instant Shaking Grass/Water Ripple/Dust Cloud!
- This is great for Audino grinding, and will work near any grass, water, cave or bridge tiles. 
- Note that you still need to have the first badge for it to have any effect!

### Automatic Hidden Grotto Regeneration:

- When activated, these codes will cause all Hidden Grottos to spawn something new the moment you take a step whilst outside of them!
- Note that they have to be empty first for anything new to appear! This includes hidden items, so do check for those.
