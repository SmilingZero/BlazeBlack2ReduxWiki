# General Pokémon Changes (v1.4.1) 

!!! note
    This site assumes you are playing the Complete version of the ROM hack, as it was generated using data from a hacked ROM's NARC files. All references to the "Classic" version of this hack will require separate documentation.

## General Notes

The Fairy-type has been added to the game.

 - All Pokémon which are canonically Fairy Type as of X and Y are Fairy type in Redux.
 - In the Complete version, there are several additional Fairy types, like Renegade Platinum.

All Pokémon have had their stats updated to match Gen VIII, Pokémon Sword and Shield. Furthermore, many additional changes have been made to each Pokémon.

 - This patch also inherits some of the Pokémon changes made in Renegade Platinum, as well as Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2.
 - The 'Classic' version of Redux omits custom Pokémon stat, type and ability changes.

All Pokémon have had their abilities updated to match Gen VIII, Pokémon Sword and Shield. For example: Torkoal, Vanilluxe and Pelipper.
There are three abilities listed for each Pokémon. These refer to their two regular abilities and their hidden ability, in that order.
Most useful hidden abilities have been swapped with less useful regular abilities, where applicable. This is to help with obtaining useful abilities.

All Pokémon have had their wild held item updated to match Gen VIII, Pokémon Sword and Shield.

 - There are some exceptions to this, mainly the Munchlax line no longer carries Leftovers and Cubone no longer carries a Thick Club, for balance purposes. 
 - These can each be obtained elsewhere through regular gameplay, see 'Item Changes' for more information.
Pokémon who may hold an item in Pokémon Sword and Shield that doesn't exist in Black 2 and White 2 will not hold anything.

## Evolution Changes

A number of Pokémon have had their evolution methods modified in Redux.

This is usually either to allow the player to obtain them in a single player setting, make some Pokémon more available, or in some cases to act as a buff or nerf to the Pokémon.

The Link Cable and Ice Stone have also been introduced to the game as evolution items.

 - On top of that, most items that are normally used in trade evolutions have been modified to be able to work the same as an evolution stone.

In most cases, the listed evolution method replaces the Pokémon's original method unless explicitly stated otherwise.

These changes are found in all versions of the game.
