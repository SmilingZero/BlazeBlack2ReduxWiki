# Credits (v1.4.1)

## General Information

Pokémon Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2 Redux have been developed primarily by myself, AphexCubed. However, that isn't to say this was a one-man project, far from it.

 - About a year into development, I showed Redux to Drayano. The rest as they say is history, we decided on a name and over the next year began a formal collaboration on Redux.
 - I have attempted to credit everyone who helped out in this document. If you feel you should be added, get in touch with me and I'll sort something out :).
 - To help anyone looking for somewhere to start in making their own projects, I have included an approximate list of tools used in the development of Redux.
 

## The Credits

### Various Areas of Development/Significant Contributions

#### Dray ([@Drayano60](https://twitter.com/Drayano60))

It's difficult to put into words how helpful Dray has been, all throughout this project.

 - Indeed, it was his Blaze Black 2 and Volt White 2 project all the way back in 2012(!) which inspired me to get into Rom Hacking in the first place.

The list on contributions Dray has made to the project is vast and I am massively indebted to him. Here is a shortlist of what he's been involved in:

 - Joining me as a developer and giving me permission to release the project.
 - Collaborating with me through the projects development, mainly:
    - Playtesting.
    - Dialogue.
    - General Feedback.
    - Scripting support.
    - Providing certain resources to me, such as the Genesect overworld sprite.
    - Getting me in-touch with other members of the community like Kojiyomi (@kojiyomi), who has kindly provided artwork for various different parts of the project!
    - Hosting the project files.
    - Various aspects of promotion.
    - Game balance.
 
I'm incredibly grateful for everything Dray has done and his help with Redux.

 - He's an all-around great guy and lovely to work with <3.



#### Kaphotics ([@Kaphotics](https://twitter.com/kaphotics))

Without Kurt's old ProjectPokémon guides, resources and documentation, I wouldn't have been able to get Redux off the ground.

 - His old written tutorials on Pokecommunity single-handedly got me into scripting and Hex Editing.
 - I couldn't have got Redux off the ground without his old documents.

### Tools Used

Redux comes at an extremely exciting time for Gen V rom hack development. Many powerful new tools have become available/are in the works - the future of the hacking scene is bright.

 - However, I started Redux before the majority of these tools had been created/were fully functional. Thus, this section is split in two - old and new tools. Everything mentioned was used at some point or another.
 


#### 'New' Tools

These are more modern and up-to-date tools for Gen V hacking. If you're starting out, use these!

 - These tools would have been more heavily used, had I known about them/had they existed when I started Redux.
 

##### SAK (Swiss Army Knife)

An all around, multi-purpose Gen V hacking tool, created by PlatinumMaster. It can edit may things, including, but not limited to:

 - A robust script editor.
 - a Text Editor.
 - a Map Editor.


##### CTRMap

A tool which can edit various aspects of the overworld, with a handy visual interface! It's also got a powerful script editor built in.

 - The best bit is the graphical interface, you can 'see' the game as you edit it!
 
 

#### 'Other' Tools

These are tools which have been around for a while, but are still extremely useful for Gen V hacking, at the time of writing.

###### HxD64

I'll start by cheating a little, HxD64 is a hex editor, not traditional tool as you may imagine it. However, it has been the single most used and powerful tool used in Redux.

 - Almost all the scripting done in Redux was written in Hex.
 - Many, many areas of Redux where edited with hex, from the title screen to the arm9.


##### NPRE 1226 

A tool modified by Kaphotics and now made obsolete by SAK and CTRMap. It parses scripts from the game into a more readable format.

 - Without it, I likely wouldn't have been able to get into scripting.
 

##### PPNFR 

Adds files back into NARC files. So, so many uses in Redux.


##### Tinke (Various builds.)

Used to explore the Rom, build the rom, extract and insert NARCs, edit sprites and graphics... The list goes on. Another tool instrumental in the development of Redux.

#### 'Old' Tools

These are tools I used developing Redux, which have either since been superseded by SAK and CTRMap, or are generally slow to use/unreliable and buggy.

##### PPTXT

Used to edit text in the game. Now obsolete with the rise of SAK and CTRMap.


##### BWTE 2 - 1000 

Used to edit trainer teams and rosters. Now obsolete with SAK.


##### OxAttack

Used to modify move data.

 - Buggy, doesn't like certain types of moves and has a nasty habit of breaking moves when editing them.


##### BWWE 

Used to edit wild areas.


##### BWOE 

Used to view and edit overworld sprites. Now obsolete with CTRMap.


##### ANDT 

Used to modify Pokémon learnsets and hidden grottos.


##### Pokémon Rom Changer (PRC) 

Used to edit Pokémon base stats, abilities, types etc. 

 - Works on absolute offsets, so using it can be a little tricky.
 - Can also modify moves, useful to get around OxAttack limitations.
