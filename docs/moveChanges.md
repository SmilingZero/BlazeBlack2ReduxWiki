# Move Changes (v1.4.1)                               

## General Changes

The attributes of all moves (Power, Accuracy, PP, Effect chance, priority) are updated to match Sword and Shield, with both DLCs.

 - Charm and Moonlight are now Fairy-type as in Sword and Shield.

Legends: Arceus and 'Dexit' have introduced a high degree of fragmentation towards move Effects in the main series.

 - See 'Redux Move Modifications' below for more information on how we've tackled that!

## Redux Move Modifications

As of late, the Pokémon series has become decently fragmented across different titles when it comes to moves. 

 - With Legends: Arceus came a further fragmentation of move effects across the Pokémon series. 
 - As of writing, it's hard to know what will carry over to the 'mainline' series (think Stealth Rock changes etc).
 - This makes updating moves to current standards fairly tricky, so we've gone with a 'selective' approach - e.g. just take the bits we like!

Below are all the changes made to moves from vanilla Gen V in Redux. There are three different categories of changes:

 - Changes made by Gamefreak in the mainline series of games (XY -> Sword and Shield). These changes are unmarked.
 - Changes decided by the hack creators [!]
 - Changes implemented based on Legends Arceus [L:A]
 

With that out of the way, here are the changes to moves made in Redux:

[^1]: Not currently implemented/cannot be properly implemented due limitations with the Gen V engine/toolset. 
[^2]: Accounting for the x2 damage of critical hits in Gen V, as opposed to the x1.5 damage of Gen VI+.
[^3]: Born of current Gen V Limitations, uses Triple Kick mechanics, with a higher initial base power. This should work out to roughly the same amount of damage.
