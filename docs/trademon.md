# In-game Trade Changes (v1.4.1)


## General Notes


In Dray's original projects, the trades with NPC's you can find scattered around Unova are all broken. This has been overhauled and rectified in Redux.

 - Details of the new trades are found below.
 - The Curtis/Yancy trades remain unchanged as in BB2 and VW2.

!!! note
    The Curtis and Yancy events require being on specific tiles, so I'll just refer back to the [page on Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/black2white2/droppeditem.shtml)



## New Trade Pokémon


### Togepi

| [Togepi] |
| : --- : |
| ![][175] |



Location: Route 4.
 
 - Talk to the Lass (BB2 Redux) or Youngster (VW2 Redux) on Route 4 to initiate the trade.
 - They are each looking for a [Meowth] in exchange for Togepi, which can be found on Route 20. (See Wild Area Changes Document).
 - The Togepi has the following traits:
    - 30 IV's in all stats except Attack, which has an IV stat of 0.
	- A Timid nature.
	- The ability Serene Grace.
	- Togepi is holding a Metronome.

### Ditto 

| [Ditto] |
| : --- : |
| ![][132] |

Location: Route 7.
 
 - Talk to the Hiker living in a house on Route 7 to initiate the trade.
 - He is looking for a [Feebas] in exchange for Ditto, which can be found in various areas around Unova. (See Wild Area Changes Document).
 - The Ditto has the following traits:
    - 31 IV's in all stats.
	- A Hardy nature.
	- The ability Imposter.
	- Ditto is holding a Metal Powder.
 - This Ditto should be super handy for anyone who wants to lean into the Pokémon Breeding side of things! (Although the egg moves might be a little scuffed, with all the move replacements. ;))

!!! note
    I manually checked the egg moves narc file for the complete version of the rom hack (at least for Bulbasaur through Pidgey), and the egg moves seem consistent with the Gen V Pokédex entries on Serebii.net. 


### Phione

| [Phione] |
| : --- : |
| ![][489] |


Location: Humilau City.
 
 - Talk to the Rough-Neck living in Humilau City to initiate the trade.
 - He is looking for a [Lumineon] in exchange for Phione, which can also be found in various areas around Unova, or evolved from Finneon. (See Wild Area Changes Document).
 - The Phione has the following traits:
    - 31 IV's in all stats.
	- A Bashful nature.
	- The ability Hydration.
	- Phione is holding a Lucky Egg.
