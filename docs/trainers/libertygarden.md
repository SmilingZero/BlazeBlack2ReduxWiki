## First Visit

!!! Level-Info
    No level shift based on difficulty, levels are as stated.
!!! Note
    Victini's Guardian will only battle the player on Challenge mode, before Burgh is defeated. If he is not fought before Burgh, after you have defeated Burgh he will not let you pass into the Lighthouse! He will disappear in the Postgame after the player travels to Striaton City, so Victini can be later accessed (this is also true of the other two difficulties, if he hasn't already been interacted with).
